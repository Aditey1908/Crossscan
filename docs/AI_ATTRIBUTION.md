## 🎯 Critical Human Decisions

The following were **100% human-driven**:
1. Partner selection (Envio, Blockscout, Avail)
2. Problem statement definition
3. Data model design
4. Real-time polling strategy
5. Crosschain intent flow
6. Security considerations (max slippage, gas caps)
7. Testnet selection and configuration
8. Final prize submission strategy

## 📝 Code Ownership

All code in this repository was:
- **Reviewed** by the human developer
- **Tested** by the human developer
- **Modified** as needed for correctness and efficiency
- **Committed** with understanding of functionality

AI tools accelerated development but **did not replace human judgment**.

## 🔍 Specific AI Contributions

### Component Generation
AI helped scaffold the following components with basic structure:
- `Navbar.tsx` - Layout and RainbowKit integration
- `Filters.tsx` - Filter UI boilerplate
- `TxFeed.tsx` - Empty state design
- `ExplorerPane.tsx` - Placeholder content

**All logic, state management, and API integration was human-implemented.**

### Utility Functions
AI suggested implementations for:
- `formatAddress()` - Address truncation
- `formatHash()` - Hash truncation
- `formatEther()` - ETH formatting

**Adapted and verified by human developer.**

### Documentation
AI helped with:
- README structure and formatting
- Markdown table generation
- Documentation templates

**All content, claims, and technical details were human-written.**
